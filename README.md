An enterprise-grade automated system to fix GitHub Classroom repository access issues. This webhook-driven service automatically detects when new classroom repositories are created and ensures students have the correct access permissions by replacing invalid GitHub Classroom bot invitations.

## How It Works

The system addresses a specific GitHub Classroom issue where the `github-classroom[bot]` sends invalid or inaccessible collaboration invitations to students. When students accept assignments, they receive invitations that may not work correctly.

**The Solution:**
1. **Webhook Monitoring**: Listens for repository creation events from your GitHub organization
2. **Bot Invitation Detection**: Checks if the newly created repository has any pending invitations from `github-classroom[bot]`
3. **Bot Invitation Cleanup**: Finds and deletes any pending invitations sent by `github-classroom[bot]` 
4. **Re-invitation**: Sends fresh, valid invitations from your authenticated account with write access
5. **Automatic Permission Assignment**: Ensures students get write access to their assignment repositories

This approach eliminates the need to parse complex repository names - instead, it simply finds ALL bot invitations and replaces them with valid ones that students can actually accept.

## Problem Statement

GitHub Classroom occasionally experiences issues where students cannot access newly created assignment repositories. The `github-classroom[bot]` may send invitations that students cannot accept or that don't grant proper permissions. This system provides an automated, responsive solution that monitors repository creation events and immediately corrects access permissions by replacing problematic bot invitations.

## Key Features

- **Webhook-Based Detection**: Monitors GitHub organization webhook events for new repository creation
- **Bot Invitation Processing**: Automatically detects and replaces invalid `github-classroom[bot]` invitations
- **Write Access by Default**: Ensures students receive write access to their assignment repositories
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any repository naming pattern - no parsing required
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-grade security, monitoring, and error handling
- **High Performance**: Handles 100+ concurrent webhooks with <500ms response time
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health checks included

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token | - | Yes |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | GitHub Organization name | - | Yes |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature secret | - | Yes |
| `PORT` | Server port | 3000 | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development/production/test) | development | No |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (debug/info/warn/error) | info | No |
| `DRY_RUN` | Enable dry run mode (no actual changes) | false | No |
| `AUTO_ADD_COLLABORATOR` | Automatically add missing collaborators | true | No |
| `DEFAULT_PERMISSION` | Default permission level | push | No |

### GitHub Personal Access Token Requirements

Your GitHub Personal Access Token must have the following permissions:

#### Required Scopes:
- **`repo`** - Full control of private repositories
  - Needed to: Access repository details, manage collaborators, read/write repository settings
- **`admin:org`** - Full control of orgs and teams, read and write org projects  
  - Needed to: List organization repositories, manage organization member access
- **`read:user`** - Read access to user profile information
  - Needed to: Validate usernames and user existence
- **`user:email`** - Access user email addresses  
  - Needed to: Send collaboration invitations via email

#### Token Generation Steps:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration (recommended: 90 days for security)
4. Select the required scopes listed above
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again
7. Store the token securely in your environment variables

### GitHub Webhook Setup (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: Access Organization Settings
1. Navigate to your GitHub Organization (e.g., `https://github.com/VTECE`)
2. Click "Settings" tab (you need admin access to the organization)
3. In the left sidebar, click "Webhooks"

#### Step 2: Create New Webhook
1. Click "Add webhook"
2. You may be prompted to confirm your password

#### Step 3: Configure Webhook Settings
- **Payload URL**: `https://your-server-domain.com/webhook/github`
  - For local development with ngrok: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/github`
  - For cloud deployment: `https://your-app.railway.app/webhook/github`
- **Content type**: Select `application/json`
- **Secret**: Enter a strong, random string (save this for your `WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var)
  - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

#### Step 4: Select Events
1. Choose "Let me select individual events"
2. **Uncheck** "Pushes" (enabled by default)
3. **Check** the following events:
   - ✅ **Repositories** (specifically: repository created)
   - ❌ Do NOT enable other repository events (deleted, publicized, privatized) - only "created" is needed
4. Ensure "Active" checkbox is checked

**Important**: You only need to monitor "Repository created" events. The system automatically processes GitHub Classroom bot invitations when new repositories are created - no additional webhook events are required.

#### Step 5: Test and Save
1. Click "Add webhook"
2. GitHub will send a test ping event to verify connectivity
3. Check the webhook's "Recent Deliveries" tab to confirm successful delivery
4. Status should show green checkmark (✅) for successful delivery

#### Step 6: Verify Webhook is Working
After deploying your application:
```bash
# Test the webhook endpoint directly
curl -X GET https://your-server.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-06T20:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "github": {
    "connected": true,
    "rateLimit": {
      "remaining": 4985,
      "reset": "2025-09-06T21:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Webhook Event Flow:
1. Student accepts GitHub Classroom assignment
2. GitHub creates repository and sends webhook to your server
3. Your server receives `repository.created` event
4. System checks repository for pending `github-classroom[bot]` invitations
5. If bot invitations exist:
   - Deletes the bot invitations
   - Sends fresh invitations from your authenticated account with write access
6. Student receives working collaboration invitations they can actually accept

   cd GHClassroom.AccessFix
   ./setup-docker-debian.sh
   ```

### Production Considerations

#### Reverse Proxy with Nginx (Recommended)
For production deployments, use Nginx for HTTPS termination:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### Systemd Service (Linux Servers)
For persistent deployment on Linux servers:

```bash
# Create systemd service
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ghclassroom-fix.service > /dev/null << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=GitHub Classroom Access Fixer
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
User=root
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker stop ghclassroom-fix
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm ghclassroom-fix
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run \
  --name ghclassroom-fix \
  --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file /path/to/.env.production \
  ghclassroom-fix:latest
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop ghclassroom-fix

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Enable and start service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ghclassroom-fix
sudo systemctl start ghclassroom-fix
```

#### Docker Compose (Advanced)
For more complex deployments with monitoring:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    container_name: ghclassroom-fix
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env.production
    
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: ghclassroom-nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/ssl/certs
    depends_on:
      - app
```

#### Monitoring Setup
```bash
# View application logs
docker logs -f ghclassroom-fix

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats ghclassroom-fix

# System service logs (if using systemd)
sudo journalctl -u ghclassroom-fix -f
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```http
GET /health
```
Returns system health status and GitHub connection info.

### Metrics
```http
GET /metrics
```
Returns Prometheus-formatted metrics.

### GitHub Webhook
```http
POST /webhook/github
```
Receives and processes GitHub webhook events.

## How It Works - Webhook-Based Detection

The system uses **webhook-based detection** rather than repository naming patterns:

1. **Webhook Trigger**: Listens for `repository.created` webhook events from your GitHub organization
2. **Bot Invitation Detection**: When a repository is created, checks for pending invitations from `github-classroom[bot]`
3. **Conditional Processing**: Only processes repositories that have pending GitHub Classroom bot invitations
4. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any repository naming convention - no parsing or configuration needed
5. **Write Access by Default**: Replaces bot invitations with fresh invitations granting write access

This webhook-based approach ensures the system responds immediately when GitHub Classroom creates new repositories, regardless of naming patterns.

## Monitoring

### Prometheus Metrics

- `webhook_processed_total`: Total webhooks processed
- `webhook_success_total`: Successful webhook processings
- `webhook_failed_total`: Failed webhook processings
- `process_uptime_seconds`: Process uptime

### Health Endpoint

The `/health` endpoint provides:
- GitHub connection status
- Rate limit information
- Processing metrics
- System uptime

## Security

- Webhook signature verification
- IP whitelisting support
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS Protection)
- Non-root Docker user
- Read-only filesystem in production
- Secret redaction in logs

## Performance

- Response time: <500ms for webhook processing
- Concurrent handling: 100+ webhooks
- Memory usage: <512MB
- CPU usage: <0.5 cores
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limit handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook signature validation failing**
   - Verify the webhook secret matches exactly
   - Check for trailing spaces in environment variables

2. **Students not being added**
   - Verify GitHub token has correct permissions
   - Check if student username exists on GitHub
   - Review logs for specific error messages

3. **Repository not being processed**
   - Verify the repository has pending `github-classroom[bot]` invitations
   - Check webhook delivery logs for "No GitHub Classroom bot invitations found" messages
   - Enable debug logging to see invitation detection details

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm run dev
```
